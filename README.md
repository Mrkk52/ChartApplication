# Chat Application

This repository contains a Java implementation of a simple chat application using networking libraries like Socket or Java NIO.

## Overview

The chat application allows users to connect to a server and exchange messages in real-time. It follows a client-server architecture where multiple clients can connect to a central server and communicate with each other.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application is built on a client-server model, allowing multiple clients to connect to a central server.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are exchanged in real-time between connected clients.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- **Scalable**: The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for future enhancements and additions.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile**: Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. **Run Server**: Start the server application by running the server executable.
4. **Run Clients**: Start multiple client applications and connect them to the server.
5. **Chat**: Once connected, clients can exchange messages with each other through the server.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Basic understanding of Java programming language
- Familiarity with networking concepts and client-server architecture
